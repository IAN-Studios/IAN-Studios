# Pre: An Introduction to Security and Legal Information

Note: This document/website/domin/thing is perfectly legal, and 
all that we have done is taken a bigger look at a small problem.
We have looked over the SSBIH* and the JCPS Acceptable Use Policy**
and have found that we have not broken any rules. We have not 
broken into any systems, we have not caused any damage whatsoever.
You may consult me (Griffin D. Siebert) at any time by emailing me
