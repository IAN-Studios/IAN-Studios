# IAN Studios Dyson Sphere Project

## Goals:
- Set up a proper mining facility on mercury to get required quantity of metallic resources for project
- Set up a viable power grid
- Create a system to launch and manage a dyson sphere/swarm
- Define basic sphere structure
- Grow exponentially on the power grid due to harvest of local star "sol" via dyson sphere/swarm
- Provide free infinite power for everyone

## Overview
  IAN Studios is planning to construct a dyson sphere to harvest the energy from the sun (sol). This plan requires extensive and the large deconstruction of an entire
  planet in order to generate the required resources.
  
## MCP Interperation: Failure Imminent
## Systems Interperation: Sucess Imminent
## Magical ball of fortune telling multiplied by the number eight: Try again later

## Procedure
  Use locally grown and harvested pure uranium (roughly 20.32 lb) to generate the power needed to start the project
  
  Start Project
  
  Turn metal into sphere/swarm
  
  launch sphere/swarm
  
  harvest energy output
  
  Release energy output to the public
